"Book Circle" provides college students with a platform to borrow books from each other, centered around their school region. It allows users to easily find and borrow the books they are interested in, anytime and anywhere. This platform provides a fast book updating system and serves as a convenient supplement to borrowing books from the library. Users can select books online and borrow them offline. The system allows users to view relevant information about the books and engage in deeper communication with the book owners to understand the condition of the books. This innovative form of book borrowing aims to increase students' interest in borrowing books.
